## Python Basics folder:
 covers basic concepts of python like syntax, semantics, variables, data types, operators,loops, conditional logics, control structures, functions, modules, file handling and exceptions.
## NLP folder:
 covers basic concepts of data cleaning like text preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop words and postagging.
 It also covers vectorization techniques such as bag of words and n-grams.
## Machine Learning folder covers three mock projects of ML:                                                 
1- In which data is retrieved by kaggle source and we will predict the success rate of a holiday package launched by a travel company.    
2- In which data is retrieved from an Indian website  and model is trained to predict the price of used cars.      
3- In which dataset is prepareed by Artificial Intelligence and model is trained to predict whether the student will be failed or passed based on the daily routine of students.                                                       
## Requirements file:
 has all the necessary packages required to run the project.
## ML_Flow folder contains:
1- Mock practice to initialize ml flow.
2- A mock project of logistic regression being tracked on ML Flow.
## ML runs and ML Artifacts contains:
Some basic files and some artifacts of ML Flows.

## All the work has been done in a virtual environment of Python version 3.12.
